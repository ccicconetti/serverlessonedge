/**
 * Edge controller announcing computers to routers in a hierarchical manner,
 * depending on the network topology provided as input.
 *
 * Behavior is as follows:
 *
 * - When a new computer is announced, its home router is identified from
 *   the topology. Then, the computer is announced as final destination to
 *   the home router only, while the latter is announced to all the other
 *   routers as an intermediate step to reach the computer.
 *
 * - When a computer is removed, it is removed from the forwarding table
 *   of its home router, while on all the other routers the entry announced
 *   for the home router is removed only if there are no other lambdas
 *   served by the home router.
 *
 * - When a router is added or removed (the latter as a result of a
 *   failed communication when adding/removing a forwarding table entry),
 *   then all the routers' forwarding tables are flushed and then
 *   re-created from scratch with a brand new configuration obtained
 *   by adding one a time all the lambdas offered from all the computers.
 *
 * The actual announce/removal of routes is left to further derived classes.
